But potential field experiments manipulating sovereign governments would likely prove both impractical and unethical. In many IR realms, however, the actors who comply or not with international standards are ordinary firms and citizens, who can be studied ethically and practically using field experiments. The present study examines compliance with international standards that require full identity disclosure when incorporating a business. Without such disclosure, individuals are able to form anonymous shell corporations that can hide corruption, organized crime, and the financing of terrorism. Thus, this particular area of IR, while not focused directly on the behavior of national governments, nonetheless proves important globally\"", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q14": {"value": "No", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q17": {"value": "", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q16": {"value": "\" The expectation of the first treatment is that service providers should be somewhat more likely to follow international standards when they receive a prompt about the existence of these standards (H1), than when they do not receive the prompt. The second hypothesis is that providers will be more likely to comply when they are informed that international standards are enforced by domestic agencies, which can apply meaningful penalties (H2), than when they are only prompted about international standards. This is broadly consistent with a realist view that compliance with international standards will only occur when backed up with state power. The third expectation is that service providers will be more likely to allow anonymous incorporation to a client from an explicitly non-corrupt country as opposed to a potential client from a clearly corrupt nation (H3). Finally, our fourth expectation is that providers in the United States will be far less likely to allow any client associated with global terror to incorporate without disclosing identification (H4). We expect the most significant treatment effects from H4, and suspect that the previous three treatments will garner much less substantial or statistically insignificant effects. In the international sample, the alias consultant makes an inquiry that is identical to the one in the U.S. control condition. In this case, however, the researcher purports to be from one of the basket of low-corruption countries discussed in treatment three above (Denmark, New Zealand, Finland, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, Norway, or Austria), instead of from a Guineastan nation. Prior evidence suggests that U.S. incorporators are probably inclined to offer anonymous incorporation to the bulk of their clients; however, we presume that providers worldwide may exercise more discretion. So, we posit that sending the control emails from one of the worlds least-corrupt nations may raise fewer red flags, as it were, and increase our likelihood of seeing effects from the various treatments. The first international treatment is nearly identical to the first treatment in the U.S. sample and invokes the regulatory power of the FATF. In a similar manner, we hypothesize that service providers worldwide should be somewhat more likely to follow international standards when they receive a prompt about the existence of these standards (H5). The second treatment is identical to the control, but it lists the United States as its country of origin instead of the non-corrupt basket of countries. In this case, we are evaluating the difference that a request from the U.S. as the global hegemon has on services likelihood of allowing anonymous incorporation. We expect that most providers will be less likely to accept anonymous incorporation from hegemon-based clients and also predict that this treatment will garner some of our most significant results (H6). 23 The seventh and eighth treatments similarly reference the FATF, but they also offer rationales for raising the question of international law, mapping to different approaches core to the international relations literature. These treatments probe how incorporation services respond to rationalist or normative references to international standards. The treatment and matching hypothesis (H7) is designed to tap a constructivist logic of appropriateness. According to this view, actors engage in ethical reasoning to ensure their behavior conforms with generally shared conceptions of appropriate conduct. Thus H7 maintains that service providers will be more likely to comply, relative to the control condition but not necessarily compared to treatments one and two, if they are provided with cues about the appropriate course of action to preserve their self-esteem and reputation for propriety. The next treatment substitutes an explicitly rationalist logic of consequences whereby noncompliance runs the risk of costly punishment. Hypothesis eight thus explains compliance as a costbenefit calculation by service providers seeking to avoid sanctions (H8), and we expect that compliance should increase relative to the control, but are agnostic about whether compliance should be higher or lower than other conditions. \"", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q11": {"value": "", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q10": {"value": "No", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q13": {"value": "No", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q12": {"value": "", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q19": {"value": "", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q18": {"value": "", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q33": {"value": [""], "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q32": {"value": "", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q30": {"value": "", "comments": [], "extra": []}, "q36": {"value": "Agree", "comments": [], "extra": []}}
