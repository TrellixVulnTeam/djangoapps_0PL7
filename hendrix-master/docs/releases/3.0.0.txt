hendrix 3.0.0 release notes
===========================

*June 16, 2018*

Major Release
-------------

Python 3
========

**The biggest impetus for this release is Python 3 compatibility.**

Python 3 support for hendrix is provided finally today.  Python 2 is only formally supported for
another year and a half, and it's not clear whether the hendrix dependencies will even hold out that long

This build, for example, fails today on Python 2.7 because cryptography now uses some Python 3
functionality in its certificate logic:

https://travis-ci.org/hendrix/hendrix/jobs/392207420

There's no particular guarantee of the matter of how long hendrix will work on python 2, but there's
no reason to believe that it won't work at least for now by using python 2-compatible versions of the dependencies.


Other major changes
===================

* The test suite now uses pytest.
* New TLS functionality
** Moved hendrix.deploy.ssl to hendrix.deploy.tls
** Allow ECC curve to be specified by user.
** New option, "https_only"
** Support for TLS websockets via WSS.
* Native websockets
* New websocket dispatcher interface, hey_joe


Minor changes
=============

* Some crosstown_traffic internals are now private.
* Launch messages are now different for TLS vs non-TLS.
* JSON messages sent via websocket are now casted to bytes
* New async demo (from django-nyc talk at buzzfeed)
* Example TLS server provided, with new TLS features
* We no longer print FDs in use during deploy; users need to log these if they want them.
