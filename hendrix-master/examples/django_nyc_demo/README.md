[![Django-NYC Meetup video: hendrix](http://img.youtube.com/vi/92VeMkjM1TQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92VeMkjM1TQ)

This example project has evolved a bit since the video, to keep up with the times.  The demo shows Python 2.7, txsockjs,
and the hxdispatcher interface.

This project instead uses, respectively, Python 3.5+, native websockets and, as mentioned in the talk, the new hey_joe interface.
