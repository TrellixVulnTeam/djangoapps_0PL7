# User Authentication with `Django-Registration-Redux` {#chapter-redux}
In the [previous chapter](#chapter-user), we added in login and registration functionality by manually coding up the URLs, views and templates. However, such functionality is common to many web application so developers have created numerous add-on applications that can be included in your Django project to reduce the amount of code required to provide login, registration, one-step and two-step authentication, password chaning, password recovery, etc. In this chapter, we will be using the package `django-registration-redux` to provide these facilities. 

This will mean we will need to re-factor our code to remove the login and registration functionality we previously created, and then setup and configure our project to include the `django-registration-redux` application. This chapter also will provide you with some experience of using external applications and show you how easily they can be plugged into your Django project.

## Setting up Django Registration Redux
To start we need to first install `django-registration-redux` version 1.4 into your environment using `pip`.

{lang="text",linenos=off}
	pip install -U django-registration-redux==1.4


Now that it is installed, we need to tell Django that we will be using this application. Open up the `settings.py` file, and update the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

{lang="python",linenos=off}
	INSTALLED_APPS = [
	    'django.contrib.admin',
	    'django.contrib.auth',
	    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
	    'django.contrib.sessions',
	    'django.contrib.messages',
	    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
	    'rango',
	    'registration'  # add in the registration package
	    ]
	

While you are in the `settings.py` file you can also add the following variables that are part of the registrations package's configuration (these settings should be pretty self explanatory):

{lang="python",linenos=off}
	# If True, users can register
	REGISTRATION_OPEN = True
	# One-week activation window; you may, of course, use a different value.
	ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS = 7
	# If True, the user will be automatically logged in.
	REGISTRATION_AUTO_LOGIN = True  
	# The page you want users to arrive at after they successfully log in
	LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/rango/' 
	# The page users are directed to if they are not logged in,
	# and are trying to access pages requiring authentication 
	LOGIN_URL = '/accounts/login/' 

In `tango_with_django_project/urls.py`, you can now update the `urlpatterns` so that it includes a reference to the registration package:

{lang="python",linenos=off}
	url(r'^accounts/', include('registration.backends.simple.urls')),

The `django-registration-redux` package provides a number of different registration backends, depending on your needs. For example you may want a two-step process, where user is sent a confirmation email, and a verification link. Here we will be using the simple one-step registration process, where a user sets up their account by entering in a username, email, and password, and is automatically logged in.

## Functionality and URL mapping
The Django Registration Redux package provides the machinery for numerous functions. In the `registration.backend.simple.urls`, it provides the following mappings:

- registration -\> `/accounts/register/`
- registration complete -\> `/accounts/register/complete/`
- login -\> `/accounts/login/`
- logout -\> `/accounts/logout/`
- password change -\> `/password/change/`
- password reset -\> `/password/reset/`

while in the `registration.backends.default.urls` it also provides the functions for activating the account in a two stage process:

- activation complete (used in the two-step registration) -\> `activate/complete/`
- activate (used if the account action fails) -\> `activate/<activation_key>/`
- activation email (notifies the user an activation email has been sent out)

    > - activation email body (a text file, that contains the activation email text)
    > - activation email subject (a text file, that contains the subject line of the activation email)

Now the catch. While Django Registration Redux provides all this functionality, it does not provide the templates because these tend to be application specific. So we need to create the templates associated with each view.

## Setting up the Templates
In the [Django Registration Redux Quick Start Guide](https://django-registration-redux.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html),
it provides an overview of what templates are required, but it is not immediately clear what goes within each template. Rather than try and work it out from the code, we can take a look at a set of [templates written by Anders Hofstee](https://github.com/macdhuibh/django-registration-templates) to quickly get the gist of what we need to code up. 

First, create a new directory in the `templates` directory, called `registration`. This is where we will house all the pages associated with the Django Registration Redux application, as it will look in this directory for the templates it requires.

### Login Template {#section-redux-templates-login}
In `templates/registration` create the file, `login.html` with the following code:

{lang="html",linenos=off}
	{% extends "rango/base.html" %}
	{% block body_block %}
	    <h1>Login</h1>
	    <form method="post" action=".">
	        {% csrf_token %}
	        {{ form.as_p }}
	        <input type="submit" value="Log in" />
	        <input type="hidden" name="next" value="{{ next }}" />
	    </form>
	    <p>
	        Not  a member? 
	        <a href="{% url 'registration_register' %}">Register</a>
	    </p>
	{% endblock %}

Notice that whenever a URL is referenced, the `url` template tag is used to reference it. If you visit, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/` then you will see the list of URL mappings, and the names associated with each URL (assuming that `DEBUG=True` in `settings.py`).

### Registration Template
In `templates/registration` create the file, `registration_form.html` with the following code:

{lang="html",linenos=off}
	{% extends "rango/base.html" %}
	{% block body_block %}
	    <h1>Register Here</h1>
	    <form method="post" action=".">
	        {% csrf_token %}
	        {{ form.as_p }}
	        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
	    </form>
	{% endblock %}

### Registration Complete Template
In `templates/registration` create the file, `registration_complete.html` with the following code:

{lang="html",linenos=off}
	{% extends "rango/base.html" %}
	{% block body_block %}
	    <h1>Registration Complete</h1>
	    <p>You are now registered</p>
	{% endblock %}

### Logout Template
In `templates/registration` create the file, `logout.html` with the following code:

{lang="html",linenos=off}
	{% extends "rango/base.html" %}
	{% block body_block %}
	    <h1>Logged Out</h1>
	    <p>You are now logged out.</p>
	{% endblock %}
		
### Try out the Registration Process
Run the server and visit: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/register/> Note how the registration form contains two fields for password - so that it can be checked. Try registering, but enter different passwords.

While this works, not everything is hooked up.

### Refactoring your project
Now you will need to update the `base.html` so that the new registration URLs and views are used.

- Update register to point to `<a href="{% url 'registration_register' %}">`.
- Update login to point to `<a href="{% url 'auth_login' %}">`.
- Update logout to point to `<a href="{% url 'auth_logout' %}?next=/rango/">`.
- In `settings.py`, update `LOGIN_URL` to be `'/accounts/login/'`.

Notice that for the logout, we have included a `?next=/rango/`. This is so when the user logs out, it will redirect them to the index page of Rango. If we exclude it, then they will be directed to the log out page (but that would not be very nice).

Next, decommission the `register`, `login`, `logout` functionality from the `rango` application, i.e. remove the URLs, views, and templates (or comment them out).

### Modifying the Registration Flow {#section-redux-templates-flow}
At the moment, when users register, it takes them to the registration complete page. This feels a bit clunky; so instead, we can take them to the main index page. Overriding the `RegistrationView provided by registration.backends.simple.views` can do this. Update the `tango_with_django_project/urls.py` by importing `RegistrationView`, add in the following registration class.

{lang="python",linenos=off}
	from registration.backends.simple.views import RegistrationView

	# Create a new class that redirects the user to the index page, 
	#if successful at logging
	class MyRegistrationView(RegistrationView):
	    def get_success_url(self, user):
	        return '/rango/'

Then update the `urlpatterns` list in your Django project's `urls.py` module by adding the following line before the pattern for `accounts`. Note that this is *not* the `urls.py` module within the `rango` directory!

{lang="python",linenos=off}
	url(r'^accounts/register/$', 
	    MyRegistrationView.as_view(), 
	        name='registration_register'),

This will allow for `accounts/register` to be matched before any other `accounts/` URL. This allows us to redirect `accounts/register` to our customised registration view.

X> ###Exercise and Hints
X> - Provide users with password change functionality. 
X> - Hint: see [Anders Hofstee's Templates](https://github.com/macdhuibh/django-registration-templates/tree/master/registration) to get started.
X> - Hint: the URL to change passwords is `accounts/password/change/` and the URL to denote the password has been changed is: `accounts/password/change/done/`
