It has taken a lot of time and effort to create this library.
Similarly, it will take some time and effort to understand and
acquire the skills to create a well-designed event-sourced system.

Training workshops and development services are available to
support your professional use of this library. Community support
is also available.

Please also consider supporting the ongoing development and maintenance
of this library by making a regular donation.
