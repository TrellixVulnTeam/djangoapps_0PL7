Inspiration:

-  Martin Fowler's `article on event sourcing <http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html>`__

-  Greg Young's `discussions about event sourcing <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHGkaShoyNs>`__,
   and `Event Store system <https://eventstore.org/>`__

-  Robert Smallshire's `brilliant example on Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/sixty-north/d5-kanban-python/src>`__

-  Various professional projects that called for this approach, for
   which I didn't want to rewrite the same things each time
